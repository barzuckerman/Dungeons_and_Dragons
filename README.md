**Dungeons and Dragons Board Game**

**Introduction**

In this project, we have implemented a single-player multi-level version of a Dungeons and Dragons board game. The player is trapped in a dungeon surrounded by enemies, and their goal is to fight through them and progress to the next level of the dungeon. The game follows object-oriented programming principles and coding conventions.

**Gameplay**

The game is played on a board similar to the one shown in Figure 1. The game board consists of a player, enemies of different types, walls, and empty areas that both players and enemies can walk through.

Player: Represented by the symbol "@" in green.
Enemies: Represented by symbols "B", "s", "k", and "M" in red. Enemies include monsters and traps.
Free Areas: Represented by dots ".", indicating areas that are free to walk through.
Walls: Represented by "#" symbols, blocking movement.
The game is controlled via keyboard input. Each level consists of multiple rounds, where the player and enemies take turns performing actions. The level ends when all enemies are defeated, and the player progresses to the next level. The game continues until the player completes all levels or is defeated.

**Getting Started**

To run the game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
Run the game by executing the main script.
Choose a player character and start playing!
