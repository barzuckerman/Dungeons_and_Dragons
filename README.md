# Dungeons_and_Dragons
**Introduction**

In this project, we have implemented a single-player multi-level version of a Dungeons and Dragons board game. The player is trapped in a dungeon surrounded by enemies, and their goal is to fight through them and progress to the next level of the dungeon. The game follows object-oriented programming principles and coding conventions.

**Gameplay**

The game is played on a board similar to the one shown in Figure 1. The game board consists of a player, enemies of different types, walls, and empty areas that both players and enemies can walk through.

Player: Represented by the symbol "@" in green.
Enemies: Represented by symbols "B", "s", "k", and "M" in red. Enemies include monsters and traps.
Free Areas: Represented by dots ".", indicating areas that are free to walk through.
Walls: Represented by "#" symbols, blocking movement.
The game is controlled via keyboard input. Each level consists of multiple rounds, where the player and enemies take turns performing actions. The level ends when all enemies are defeated, and the player progresses to the next level. The game continues until the player completes all levels or is defeated.

**Getting Started**

Download the JAR file: First, download the JAR file of the project, likely named "hw3_d_and_d.jar".
Open Command Prompt and run the JAR file - type the following command in the Command Prompt:

java -jar hw3_d_and_d.jar <the path to the levels of the game>

Replace <the path to the levels of the game> with the actual path to the levels of the game on your system. For example:

Once the game is running, you'll likely be prompted to choose a player character from a list provided.

Start Playing: After selecting a player character, you can start playing the game!
